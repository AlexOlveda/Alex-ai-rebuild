# Alex-ai-rebuild

This repository documents my new approach to AI.

**Goal:**
Become a high-level Data/AI Engineer capable of building and deploying end-to-end systems.

**Focus:**
- Python
- Data Engineering
- Machine Learning
- Systems Architecture
- Applied AI in physical systems (F1 / Industrial / Mobility)

This is not a tutorial repo.
This is deliberate practice.
